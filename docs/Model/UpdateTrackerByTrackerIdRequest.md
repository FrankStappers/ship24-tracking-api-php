## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**is_subscribed** | **bool** | Setting at &#x60;false&#x60; will unsubscribe you from the &#x60;Tracker&#x60;. Once unsubscribed, you will still be able to fetch the existing tracking results but Ship24 won&#39;t search for new data or send webhook notifications. &#x60;Trackers&#x60; are automatically disabled after the parcel delivery or after a long period without any new events. Manually unsubscribing your tracker is not useful, except if you wish to stop receiving webhooks on it or if you need to reuse the &#x60;clientTrackerId&#x60; value in a new &#x60;Tracker&#x60;. | [optional]
